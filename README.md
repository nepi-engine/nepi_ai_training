# This repository contains scripts and instructions for creating custom AI models for NEPI supported AI frameworks.

# While the repo contains a CMakeLists file for deploying the scrips into a NEPI devices software system for application developers,
# the main use case is to deploy the repo into an ai training folder on a computer stand alone to support rapid model training

# To setup a training session for a custom ai model, open the README file in the specific model training folder you want to use, and follow the README instructions for that framework folder.
